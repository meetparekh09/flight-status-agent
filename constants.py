And we need to make that call via Python, here is the small snippet of how to achieve this in Python:
```
import requests

url = "https://api.aviationstack.com/v1/flights?access_key=<%YOUR_ACCESS_KEY%>"
response = requests.get(url)
print(response.json())
```

Key points to note:
- Your responsibility is to provide url of the request. Assume that access_key parameter would be replaced in f-string within python with variable named access_key. And embed rest of the parameters within string.
- Your responsibility is only to provide string of url without quotes (").
- Above request have not put in parameter but please put parameter based on the request that you receive.
